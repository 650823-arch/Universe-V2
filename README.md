You are porbably here either because the website got blocked eh?
Well here's how to use this:

1. go to the code and copy it into your clipboard
2. search up "html compiler". this one usually works pretty well, just don't get it blocked: https://onecompiler.com/html
3. go to the compiler and paste the code in place of whatever is there already (if there is something)
4. run the site, it should work :)
